Password Cracking

> 🛑 **WARNING:**  
> Password cracking must be performed **only in authorized environments** (labs, CTFs, or legal pentests).  
> Unauthorized use is **illegal**.

### 🎯 Why Crack Passwords?

- Found hashed passwords in:
  - `/etc/shadow`
  - Database/config files (e.g. MySQL, .env, backup)
  - User credentials in plaintext (e.g. web shells)
- Cracking them can help:
  - Switch users with `su <user>`
  - Run `sudo` if the user has privileges
  - Reuse credentials across services

### 🧰 Tools Needed

| Tool        | Use                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `john`      | Crack Unix hashes           |
| `hashcat`   | GPU-accelerated cracking    |
| `unshadow`  | Merge `/etc/shadow` & `passwd` for John |

### 🔓 John The Ripper – Basic Usage

1️⃣ Combine shadow & passwd (if cracking Linux user hash):

```bash
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > merged.txt
2️⃣ Crack using a wordlist:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt merged.txt
3️⃣ View cracked results:

john --show merged.txt
⚡ Hashcat – Faster Cracking (Optional)
1️⃣ Save raw hash (from /etc/shadow, config, etc.) to hash.txt

2️⃣ Crack with appropriate mode (e.g., SHA-512 = -m 1800):

hashcat -m 1800 hash.txt rockyou.txt --force
🧠 Find correct hash mode: Hashcat Wiki

💡 Tips & Tricks
Cracked password? Try:

su <user>
sudo -l
Test cracked creds on:

For other users

Services: FTP, SSH, MySQL, etc.

Common hash locations:

/etc/shadow

.env, .bash_history, wp-config.php

Backup or zip files

✅ Summary
You Have...	You Can Do...
User hash	Crack it and use with su / sudo
Reused passwords	Lateral move or escalate
Shadow file	Merge with passwd → crack with john
🔒 Use this method only in environments where you're allowed to test!
